Signature Techniques (Process)

Plan
- Feature First: for any change, implement the feature/fix first, then write or update tests to lock the behavior in.
- When debugging, start from a clear reproduction (manual steps, logs, or a minimal script); add tests after the fix to prevent regressions.

Act
- Implement only the smallest change needed to satisfy the desired behavior.
- Keep the diff tight and incremental; refactor only as needed to support the change.

Verify
- After the feature/fix works, write or update tests that capture the behavior.
- When adding or updating tests, run them automatically after writing them.

Control Surface
- Use the `go.sh` script to control program execution.
- Prefer flags like `--start`, `--stop`, `--status` (and related flags) to manage lifecycle.
- `--start` runs in the foreground by default; use `--detach` for background (pid/log-managed) runs.
- Use `--stop` to stop background processes started via `--start --detach`.
- This is the standard agent control surface; use it instead of ad-hoc commands.

Stability
- If the project mysteriously doesn't run after other agents' changes, wait 1 minute and then retry.
