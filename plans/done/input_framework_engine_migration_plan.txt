Input Framework Engine-Level Migration Completion Plan
======================================================

Plan-ID: INPUT_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE_MIGRATION_PLAN

Status
- Current: COMPLETE
- Last Reviewed: 2026-02-14
- Notes: Migration completed in `game/src/bin/headful/main.rs`; `handle_event` is lifecycle-only and gameplay/UI input is frame-polled in `update_state`.

Goal
- Complete migration so engine-owned `InputFrame` is the only gameplay and UI input source.
- Reduce `game/src/bin/headful/main.rs` `handle_event` to lifecycle and event-loop concerns only.
- Preserve current control feel and deterministic behavior across run modes.

Dependencies
- This plan should complete before `plans/headful_modularization_plan.txt` to avoid extracting soon-to-be-removed raw input paths.

Current Baseline
- `engine/src/app.rs` already tracks keyboard, mouse buttons, wheel, and focus in `InputFrame`.
- `game/src/bin/headful/main.rs` now consumes gameplay/UI input decisions only in `update_state`.
- `handle_event` in `headful` is lifecycle-only (close/exit flow, redraw cadence, loop teardown).

Design Rules
- Engine is the only place that translates raw `winit` input into frame state.
- Game logic reads only from `InputFrame` inside `update_state`.
- `handle_event` may handle lifecycle and control-surface behavior only (close request, redraw cadence, exit flow, non-input app events).
- Preserve frame semantics:
  - `*_down` = currently held
  - `*_pressed` = transitioned this frame
  - `*_released` = transitioned this frame

Execution Checklist
- [x] Phase 1: inventory all raw input branches in `headful` and map each to `InputFrame` signals.
- [x] Phase 2: close any true `InputFrame` capability gaps while keeping run-mode parity.
- [x] Phase 3: migrate keyboard view/gameplay handling into `update_state`.
- [x] Phase 4: migrate mouse click/drag behavior into `update_state` frame polling.
- [x] Phase 5: remove gameplay raw-input arms from `handle_event` and keep lifecycle-only logic.
- [x] Phase 6: add engine/game/smoke verification for controls parity across normal/recording/profile.
- [x] Phase 7: remove obsolete raw-input code and document final `handle_event` contract.
- [x] Acceptance: gameplay/UI input decisions occur only in `update_state`.

Phase 1: Build Input Coverage Map
- Inventory all input-related branches in `headful` `handle_event`:
  - view transitions (menu, pause, game-over, skilltree)
  - gameplay actions and horizontal repeat
  - debug HUD click and hotkeys
  - skilltree camera drag start/update/end
- For each branch, define the target `InputFrame` trigger source (`keys_pressed`, `keys_down`, `mouse_buttons_pressed`, etc.).
- Maintain a parity checklist so no old branch is deleted before a frame-based equivalent exists.
- Coverage map (raw branch -> `InputFrame` source):
  - `KeyboardInput` pressed view/hotkey/gameplay arms -> `keys_pressed`
  - horizontal hold/release machine -> `keys_down` + `keys_released`
  - `MouseInput` left pressed (HUD click + UI down + drag begin) -> `mouse_buttons_pressed`
  - `MouseInput` left released (drag finalize + click gating) -> `mouse_buttons_released`
  - drag update previously in `CursorMoved` -> `mouse_pos` while left is in `mouse_buttons_down`
  - scroll zoom -> `scroll_y`
  - focus-loss input clearing -> `window_focused` (engine-level clear on unfocus)

Phase 2: Close Engine Input Gaps (If Needed)
- Add only missing primitives to `InputFrame` if migration exposes true gaps:
  - optional mouse-delta helper for drag math
  - optional modifier helpers for key combos
- Keep normal/recording/profile modes aligned on exactly the same input rollover behavior.
- Document any added fields near `InputFrame`.
- Result: no new `InputFrame` fields were required; existing key/button down+pressed+released sets covered all migrated branches.

Phase 3: Migrate Keyboard Behavior to `update_state`
- Move all view transition key handling to `keys_pressed`.
- Move gameplay action dispatch (`Rotate`, `Drop`, `Hold`, etc.) to `keys_pressed`.
- Move horizontal hold/release state machine triggering to `keys_down` plus `keys_released`.
- Keep pause and escape behavior identical to current UX.

Phase 4: Migrate Mouse Behavior to `update_state`
- Move debug HUD click interception to frame-based mouse state.
- Move skilltree drag state machine from raw `CursorMoved` events to frame polling:
  - begin on left `pressed` in viewport
  - update while left `down` using latest mouse position
  - finalize on left `released`
- Preserve drag threshold math and `consume_next_mouse_up` behavior.

Phase 5: Shrink `handle_event` to Lifecycle-Only
- Remove raw input match arms (`KeyboardInput`, gameplay `MouseInput`, drag-specific `CursorMoved`) from `headful` `handle_event`.
- Keep only:
  - close requested and exit flow
  - redraw cadence (`WaitUntil`, `RedrawRequested`, schedule next redraw)
  - non-input lifecycle events that cannot be represented in `InputFrame`
- Add a short contract comment near `handle_event`: no gameplay input handling in this method.

Phase 6: Test and Verification
- Engine tests in `engine/src/app.rs`:
  - keyboard and mouse pressed/down/released transitions
  - wheel accumulation and reset
  - focus-loss clearing held state
- Game tests:
  - menu/pause/game-over key flow parity
  - gameplay controls and horizontal repeat parity
  - skilltree pan/zoom/click parity
- Smoke verification in:
  - normal headful run
  - recording mode
  - profile mode
- Verification notes (2026-02-14):
  - `cargo test -p engine`
  - `cargo test -p game --bin headful`
  - `cargo test -p game`
  - `./go.sh --start --game --headful --detach` + `./go.sh --status --game` + `./go.sh --stop --game`
  - `./go.sh --start --game --headful --record --detach` + `./go.sh --status --game` + `./go.sh --stop --game`
  - `ROLLOUT_HEADFUL_PROFILE_FRAMES=2 ./go.sh --start --game --headful --detach` + `./go.sh --status --game` + `./go.sh --stop --game`

Phase 7: Cleanup and Docs
- Remove obsolete raw-input imports and dead helper branches from `headful`.
- Document final `GameApp::handle_event` contract in `engine/src/app.rs`.
- Mark this plan complete with explicit verification notes.
- Completed: raw `KeyboardInput`/`MouseInput`/`CursorMoved` gameplay branches removed from `HeadfulApp::handle_event`; contract comment updated in both headful and engine app trait.

Acceptance Criteria
- `update_state` is the only place gameplay/UI input decisions are made.
- `handle_event` contains lifecycle logic only and no gameplay input dispatch.
- Controls match current behavior for menu, gameplay, and skilltree interactions.
- Recording and profile behavior remain consistent with normal run behavior.

Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: timing drift when moving drag updates from event-driven to frame-driven.
  - Mitigation: preserve threshold math and add focused drag regressions.
- Risk: key-repeat feel changes.
  - Mitigation: keep repeat constants and state machine logic, change only trigger source.
- Risk: overlap with headful modularization.
  - Mitigation: complete this migration before large file extraction work.
