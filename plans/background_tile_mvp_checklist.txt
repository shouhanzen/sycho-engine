Background Tile MVP Checklist
=============================

Status
- Current: NOT_STARTED
- Last Reviewed: 2026-02-14
- Notes: Checklist items are still unchecked and no `game/src/background.rs` implementation exists yet.

Objective
- Ship a first playable version of the depth-scrolling tile background quickly, then iterate.

MVP Scope
- One deterministic tile layer behind the board.
- Depth-based downward scroll.
- Two basic biomes (Dirt -> Stone) with hard switch first.
- No particle effects, no advanced animation.

Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `game/src/background.rs` with:
  - [ ] tile hash helper (`seed`, `depth`, `x`, `layer`)
  - [ ] tile kind enum for v1 motifs
  - [ ] biome lookup by depth
- [ ] Add `draw_tile_background(...)` function:
  - [ ] compute visible tile range
  - [ ] sample tile kind deterministically
  - [ ] draw simple motifs/colors per tile kind
- [ ] Add depth source wiring:
  - [ ] consume bottomwell depth (or temporary lines-cleared proxy)
  - [ ] map depth to background row offset
- [ ] Integrate render order in Tetris scene:
  - [ ] background first
  - [ ] board cells next
  - [ ] active piece + ghost
  - [ ] HUD/UI last
- [ ] Ensure board draw path does not clear over background.
- [ ] Add color constants/palette table for v1 biomes.

Verification Checklist
- [ ] Background visibly scrolls while digging deeper.
- [ ] Same seed + same depth renders same tile pattern.
- [ ] Board readability remains high (foreground contrast is clear).
- [ ] No obvious frame drops at target FPS.

Post-MVP (Immediate Follow-up)
- [ ] Add second parallax layer.
- [ ] Add biome blend transition band.
- [ ] Add debug toggle/env var to disable background quickly.
