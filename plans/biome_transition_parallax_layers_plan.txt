Biome Transition and Parallax Layers Plan
=========================================

Status
- Current: NOT_STARTED
- Last Reviewed: 2026-02-14
- Notes: This depends on the MVP background plan and has not started yet.

Goal
- Extend the background system from MVP to production-ready layering:
  - smooth biome transitions using blend windows
  - 2-3 deterministic parallax layers (far, mid, near)
- Keep rendering deterministic and performant before adding heavier visual effects.

Dependencies
- Start only after `plans/background_tile_mvp_checklist.txt` is complete and verified.
- Coordinate thresholds with `plans/performance_budget_hud_profiler_plan.txt` so layer additions are budget-aware.

Design Rules
- Deterministic: same seed + same depth + same camera state yields identical background output.
- Layered: each layer has independent parallax factor and tile sampling stream.
- Readable: board and active gameplay pieces remain visually dominant over background.
- Bounded cost: per-frame cost scales with visible tile count only.

Phase 1: MVP Stability Gate
- Verify MVP baseline for one layer:
  - depth scrolling works
  - deterministic tile sampling works
  - no obvious frame spikes in normal gameplay
- Record baseline timing from debug HUD for later comparison (before adding layers).

Phase 2: Layer Model and Runtime Data
- Add background layer configuration in `game/src/background.rs`:
  - `BackgroundLayerId` (Far, Mid, Near)
  - `BackgroundLayerSpec` (tile size, parallax factor, alpha, palette bias)
- Define default v1 layer specs:
  - Far: low detail, lowest contrast, slowest movement
  - Mid: medium detail and contrast
  - Near: highest detail while still behind board readability
- Keep per-layer hash stream deterministic by including `layer_id` in tile hash input.

Phase 3: Biome Band and Blend Window Model
- Replace hard biome switch with blend-window mapping:
  - `biome_at_depth(depth) -> (primary, secondary, blend_alpha)`
- Define explicit biome bands and blend widths:
  - Dirt -> Stone blend window around first boundary
  - additional bands can be appended later without changing API shape
- Blend behavior:
  - outside window: single biome
  - inside window: weighted contribution from both biome tables

Phase 4: Rendering Pipeline Integration
- Update background draw call to iterate layers in order:
  - far, then mid, then near (all behind board)
- For each visible tile:
  - sample base kind from primary biome
  - sample alternate kind from secondary biome when `blend_alpha > 0`
  - blend motif/palette contribution by `blend_alpha`
- Ensure board draw pass never clears over already rendered background layers.

Phase 5: Tuning and Debug Hooks
- Add quick runtime toggles for iteration:
  - enable/disable each layer
  - force biome ID
  - force blend alpha
  - parallax multiplier override
- Add optional debug overlay:
  - current biome pair
  - blend alpha
  - sampled layer offsets

Phase 6: Performance Hardening
- Avoid allocations in tile sampling hot paths.
- Reuse computed viewport bounds per layer where possible.
- Cap tile motif complexity for far and mid layers to protect frame budget.
- Validate render timings against performance budget thresholds before and after each added layer.

Phase 7: Testing
- Unit tests in `game/src/background.rs`:
  - deterministic layer sampling
  - biome blend alpha at and around boundaries
  - tile selection stability with fixed seed/depth/layer
- Integration tests:
  - depth changes shift layer offsets with expected parallax factors
  - blending changes smoothly through transition windows (no abrupt jumps)
- Manual verification:
  - readability pass with active gameplay and UI overlays
  - profiling pass with all enabled layers

Acceptance Criteria
- Background has 2-3 parallax layers with deterministic sampling.
- Biome boundaries transition smoothly through blend windows.
- Gameplay readability remains clear across all active views.
- Frame timing stays within agreed budget thresholds during normal play.

Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: visual noise reduces board readability.
  - Mitigation: constrain near-layer contrast and enforce palette separation from pieces.
- Risk: blend implementation doubles tile sampling cost.
  - Mitigation: keep blend path simple and skip secondary sample when alpha is effectively zero.
- Risk: adding layers before perf guardrails hides regressions.
  - Mitigation: couple rollout to budget HUD warnings and profile checks.
